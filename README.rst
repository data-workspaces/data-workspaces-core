Data Workspaces
===============
`Data Workspaces <https://dataworkspaces.ai>`_ is an open source framework for maintaining the
state of a data science project, including data sets, intermediate
data, results, and code. It supports reproducability through snapshotting
and lineage models and collaboration through a push/pull model
inspired by source control systems like Git.

Data Workspaces is installed as a Python 3 package and provides a
Git-like command line interface and programming APIs. Specific data
science tools and workflows are supported through extensions
called *kits*. Currently, this includes Scikit-learn, TensorFlow,
and Jupyter Notebooks. The goal is to provide the reproducibility and collaboration
benefits with minimal changes to your current projects and processes.

Data Workspaces runs on
Unix-like systems, including Linux, MacOS, and on Windows via the
Windows Subsystem for Linux.
