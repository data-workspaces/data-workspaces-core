Data management for reproducability and collaboration
#####################################################

Data Workspaces is an open source framework for maintaining the
state of a data science project, including data sets, intermediate
data, results, and code. It supports reproducability through snapshotting
and lineage models and collaboration through a push/pull model
inspired by source control systems like Git.

Data Workspaces is installed as a Python 3 package and provides a
Git-like command line interface and programming APIs. It runs on
Unix-like systems, including Linux, MacOS, and on Windows via the
Windows Subsystem for Linux.
