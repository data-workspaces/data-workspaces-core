Welcome to Data Workspaces. To get started, see the documentation at
https://data-workspaces-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. For most applications,
you will interact through the command line interface (dws), the integrations
with common libraries like Scikit-learn (the modules dataworkspaces.kits.*), or the
lineage API (the module dataworkspaces.lineage).

Some other submodules (mostly for extending dataworkspaces):

* backends  - backends for storing workspace metadata (currently only git)
* commands  - implementations of the command line commands
* dws       - command line interface and option parsing
* errors    - exception classes
* resources - implementations of the different resource types
* utils     - common utilities
* workspace - core APIs for dataworkspaces internals, including Workspace,
              Resource, and the various mixins that represent different
              capabilities.

Submodules are not imported by default, due to external dependencies
(e.g. click or specific frameworks required by submodules under
dataworkspaces.kits). Just import the APIs you need directly. For
example::

  from dataworkspaces import lineage

or::

  from dataworkspaces.lineage import LineageBuilder
